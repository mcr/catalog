Internet of Things (IoT) devices have appeared in vast numbers, each with its
own vendor proprietary mechanisms for onboarding, managing, securing,
updating and retiring.   IoT devices are often not fully controlled by their
owners!

The IETF IoT-onboarding group aims to reduce the number of combinations to
something less than a dozen mechanism.  It will do this by seeking out
well-documented mechanisms for life cycle management and documenting when,
how and by whom they are used.
